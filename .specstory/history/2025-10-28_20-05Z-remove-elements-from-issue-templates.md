# Remove elements from issue templates (2025-10-28 20:05Z)

_**User (2025-10-28 20:25Z)**_

get rid of all of these across issue templates

---

_**Assistant (2025-10-28 20:26Z ‚Ä¢ default)**_

I'll help you remove the "‚úÖ Testing / QA" section from all issue templates. Let me first examine the current issue templates to understand what needs to be removed.


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/jenniferwang/Year 1/Impact of AI on Developer Productivity/dev-test/dspy-test/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/testing.yml

---

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined ‚Ä¢ **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Now let me read all the issue template files to see which ones contain the "‚úÖ Testing / QA" section:

Now let me check the remaining files to see if they contain the "‚úÖ Testing / QA" section:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

---

Now I can see that only the `testing.yml` file contains the "‚úÖ Testing / QA" section. Let me create a todo list to track this task and then remove the section:


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Remove the '‚úÖ Testing / QA' section from testing.yml issue template

---

Tool use: **search_replace**

Perfect! I've successfully removed the "‚úÖ Testing / QA" section from the testing.yml issue template. Let me mark this task as completed:

## Todo List

- [x] Remove the '‚úÖ Testing / QA' section from testing.yml issue template

---

I've successfully removed the "‚úÖ Testing / QA" section from the issue templates. After examining all the issue template files in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory, I found that only the `testing.yml` file contained this section. The section has been completely removed, and the template now starts directly with the checkboxes section.

The change removes lines 7-10 from the testing.yml file, which contained:
```yaml
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        ## ‚úÖ Testing / QA
```

All other issue templates (bug_report.yml, documentation.yml, feature_request.yml, maintenance.yml, refactor.yml, documentation.md, and config.yml) did not contain this section, so no changes were needed for those files.

---

_**User (2025-10-28 20:26Z)**_

do the same, similar section

---

_**Assistant (2025-10-28 20:27Z ‚Ä¢ default)**_

I'll search for similar sections across all the issue templates to identify and remove them. Let me examine the templates more carefully to find sections with similar patterns.


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Find and remove similar markdown sections with emojis and headers from all issue templates

---

Tool use: **grep**

Let me search for markdown sections with emojis more broadly:

Perfect! I found similar sections in multiple templates. Let me remove these emoji header sections from all the templates:

Perfect! I've successfully removed all the similar emoji header sections from the issue templates. Let me mark the task as completed:

## Todo List

I've successfully removed all the similar emoji header sections from the issue templates! Here's what was removed:

1. **bug_report.yml**: Removed `## üêõ Bug Report` section
2. **feature_request.yml**: Removed `## üöÄ Feature Request` section  
3. **maintenance.yml**: Removed `## üîß Maintenance` section
4. **refactor.yml**: Removed `## üßπ Refactor Proposal` section
5. **testing.yml**: Previously removed `## ‚úÖ Testing / QA` section

All these templates now start directly with their functional content (checkboxes, textareas, etc.) without the decorative emoji headers. The templates are cleaner and more focused on the actual form fields and functionality.
